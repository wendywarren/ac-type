### Real-World Context

In the real world, there may be many players involved in designing a book. You could be doing this as an in-house designer for a publishing company. In other circumstances, you could be working directly for the author.

Usually, the designer is provided a Word document with the manuscript. You would need to remove certain formatting from the Word document. It all depends on how it is produced. In this case, it's a good idea to work closely with the author so they format the text properly.

In our case, we need to remove double paragraph breaks from our text. We'll be using a Space After setting instead.

Before doing the layout for all the pages, we would supply a few representative pages to the client so they can sign-off on the design. That's what this project is going to be -- just those few pages.

The printer will guide you in the some technical requirements. IRL, you may need to build an [InDesign book file](https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/creating-book-files.html).

### Anatomy of a Book

#### Front Matter

The front matter can include a protective page, a title page, a copyright page, dedications, an epigraph, the table of contents, a forward, acknowledgments, a prologue and more. It all depends on the context.

Front matter pages are traditionally paginated with roman numerals.

#### Content

The main part of the book made of the actual manuscript. It'll have regular pages and chapter pages. **This is we're doing in this project.**

The content pages may contain ornaments. You can use an ornament from your font on chapter opening pages or for breaks in the text. *These should not be distracting.*

Pagination is in arabic numerals at the top-right, bottom-center or bottom-right of the page.

The content may include bold or italicized text, block quotes, drop caps, section breaks, running headers, folios, and more.

#### Back Matter

The back matter can include an index, a glossary, notes, acknowledgments, the author's bio, a list of books by the author and more.

These are the restaurants you have to choose from. Read carefully. Don't necessarily go with the first choice. Your comfort zone is not always the place that will yield the best designs.

Take the time to read the menu text content to see which is more appealing to you.

[Web Site](https://www.thebutchersdaughter.com/brooklyn/){:target="_blank"}—The Butcher’s Daughter is a plant-based restaurant, café, juice bar and *vegetable slaughterhouse* where fruits and vegetables are treated as a butcher would meat. The kitchen chops and carves fresh produce into healthy vegetarian dishes and presses them into pretty juices. The daily-changing menu is 100% vegetarian, and mostly vegan and gluten-free.

It's your all-day vegetarian, juice and wine bar. The white-washed, sun filled space is the perfect place to grab a morning Vittoria coffee and smashed avocado toast, a lunch-time spicy kale salad for that corporate meeting, or a wood-fired pizza over a glass of nebbiolo to wind down the day. The open-air market, features prepared foods and surf boards from Lone Wolf. Chef Nicolas Torrant has harnessed his vegetarian and raw food skills to exemplify local produce and technique to nourish mind, body and soul.

Located in the heart of San Francisco’s Mission District, Curio is at the center of the community, reflecting the free-spirited, artistic culture that defines this neighbourhood. From the design to the drinks and food, there is a unconventional style that reflects the vibe of the people who make up the bohemian community.

Art installations include a multiplicity of clocks, victorian dioramas, vintage light fixtures, figurative paintings, and electric neon signs, creating an eclectic and mystical vibe throughout the variety of spaces.
